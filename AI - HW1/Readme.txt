BFS and DFS algorithms have been implemented in JAVA.
Source Code File: SearchRomania.java

Instructions to execute:
i. Run javac SearchRomania.java
ii. Run java SearchRomania <BFS/DFS> <SourceNode> <DestinationNode>
iii. Example: java SearchRomania BFS Urziceni Mehadia would give output for the BFS algorithm between these two cities.
iv. Please note that for this program, it is necessary to capitalize the first letters of cities while passing them as command line arguments. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A* algorithm has been implemented in Python.

Source Code File: searchRomania.py
Roads.txt - This file contains the actual distance between the pairs of city nodes in Romania.
Heuristic_costs.txt - Contains the latitude and longitude information for all the cities. This file has been used to compute the heuristic function in the A* algorithm.

Instructions to execute:
i. Run python searchRomania.py <Source> <Destination>
ii. Example: searchRomania.py urziceni mehadia
iii. Capitalization of the cities is NOT required for the python code.
